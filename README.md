### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### My experience with DeFi

Currently Iâ€™m working on Redacted finance flagship Dinero project which is a decentralized stablecoin backed blockspace. My role in this project is to develop client software in go-lang which can work in distributed environment ; running the client software shall spin up a validator on Ethereum once the smart contract accumulates 32 Ether pooled from depositors when they deposit ETH (in any amount) from Pirex contracts. The same validator smart contract will also hold the ratio required for staked and unstaked ETH controlled by Redacted DAO, based on which the client software which Iâ€™m building will initiate voluntary exit of the validators. I have got exposure to aws-cdk as Iâ€™m also helping to provision the infrastructure on AWS programmatically. In short, Iâ€™m developing a system that manages fleet of validator nodes. Not only that, the operator also has option of choosing EL and CL clients. I am also pull request reviewer of the Redacted finance smart contracts.

Before that, I worked with opty.fi which is an yield aggregator protocol. The founder and myself started working on this project in September 2020 and first alpha was launched on November 2021. (I would say that I was a sort of technical founder for this project). The TVL reached 2 million during its peak. Iâ€™m the architect of this proto col. Tech stack that I worked was hardhat for solidity smart contract , later on it was transitioned to use foundry due to its speed. The test coverage was >90%. The test are written in typescript. My achievement in this project is that I developed a common interface in solidity that can help the Vault to deposit/withdraw/stake/unstake/getExchangePrice with protocols like Aave, Compound, Curve, DyDx, Fulcrum, Dforce, Harvest, Beefy, Traderjoe, Benqui, Uniswap, Sushiswap etc. This architecture led community participation and several adapters got build both by core team including me and external builder which inturn enabled addition of several investment strategies. Currently, Iâ€™m helping opty.fi as an on call CTO.

I am also teaching blockchain at York University, Toronto and George Brown College, Toronto since 2019.

Iâ€™m familiar with defi primitives, ERC20, ERC721, ERC 1155, ERC4626, Gas saving tricks with solidity assembly, ERC712, meta transactions, etc.
